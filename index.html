        <h3>Our Goals</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/puppetize" class="user-mention">@puppetize</a> organization on GitHub was founded in 2012 by me (<a href="https://github.com/ustuehler" class="user-mention">@ustuehler</a>) as an experiment in improving the development and adoption of shared modules and best practices for <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet/">Puppet</a>.</p>

<p>Our work here may overlap with <a href="http://example42.com">example42</a> and other community projects, but rather than compete, we wish to learn from them and to collaborate as much as we can.</p>

<p>Beyond that, our ambitious aim is to build a cool self-teaching environment for beginners and advanced users alike, with basic online tutorials that can be executed in a browser, and with sandboxes hosted in an <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> private cloud for advanced learning.  Think of <a href="http://tryruby.org">tryruby.org</a>, only for Puppet. :)</p>

<p>We also want to encourage the discussion of a wide range of meta-topics, including best practices regarding the setup of Puppet infrastructures, design principles for cross-platform modules, abstractions of basic infrastructure elements (like backup and monitoring solutions) and workflows for large teams.</p>

<h3>Current Projects</h3>

<p>The <a href="infrastructure"><strong>infrastructure</strong></a> project focuses on building the OpenStack private cloud that will host the online tutorial application and eventually the whole of <a href="http://puppetize.net">puppetize.net</a>.  It builds on the <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-openstack">OpenStack modules</a> developed by Dan Bode (<a href="https://github.com/bodepd" class="user-mention">@bodepd</a>) at PuppetLabs and includes <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> boxes and <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> definitions for test-driven development.  It's all on GitHub, so check it out and contribute!</p>
