Think of [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org), only for Puppet. :)\r\n\r\nWe also want to encourage the discussion of a wide range of meta-topics, including best practices regarding the setup of Puppet infrastructures, design principles for cross-platform modules, abstractions of basic infrastructure elements (like backup and monitoring solutions) and workflows for large teams.","google":"UA-40430933-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
