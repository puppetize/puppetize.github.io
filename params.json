{"name":"puppetize.net","tagline":"Collaborative infrastructure development, self-learning and teaching.","body":"### Our Goals\r\nThe @puppetize organization on GitHub was founded in 2012 by me (@ustuehler) as an experiment in improving the development and adoption of shared modules and best practices for [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet/).\r\n\r\nOur work here may overlap with [example42](http://example42.com) and other community projects, but rather than compete, we wish to learn from them and to collaborate as much as we can.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, our ambitious aim is to build a cool self-teaching environment for beginners and advanced users alike, with basic online tutorials that can be executed in a browser, and with sandboxes hosted in an [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/) private cloud for advanced learning.  Think of [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org), only for Puppet. :)\r\n\r\nWe also want to encourage the discussion of a wide range of meta-topics, including best practices regarding the setup of Puppet infrastructures, design principles for cross-platform modules, abstractions of basic infrastructure elements (like backup and monitoring solutions) and workflows for large teams.\r\n\r\n### Current Projects\r\nThe [**infrastructure**](infrastructure) project focuses on building the OpenStack private cloud that will host the online tutorial application and eventually the whole of [puppetize.net](http://puppetize.net).  It builds on the [OpenStack modules](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-openstack) developed by Dan Bode (@bodepd) at PuppetLabs and includes [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) boxes and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) definitions for test-driven development.  It's all on GitHub, so check it out and contribute!","google":"UA-40430933-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
